# React Side Effects Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on handling "side effects" in React applications. Side effects include operations such as data fetching, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM, or logging, which fall outside the primary scope of rendering a component. The project explores managing these side effects both with and without the `useEffect` hook. Additionally, it addresses potential issues with `useEffect` dependencies through the use of the `useCallback` hook.

## Objectives

- Understand what side effects are in React and how to manage them.
- Learn how to use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects.
- Explore alternatives to `useEffect` for managing side effects.
- Use the `useCallback` hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders and dependency issues in `useEffect`.
